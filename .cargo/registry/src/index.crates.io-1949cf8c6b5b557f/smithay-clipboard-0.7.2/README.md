# Smithay Clipboard

This crate provides access to the Wayland clipboard for applications
already using some sort of GUI toolkit or a windowing library, like
[winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit), since you should
have some surface around to receive keyboard/pointer events.

If you want to access clipboard from the CLI or to write clipboard manager,
this is not what you're looking for.

## Documentation

The documentation for the master branch is [available online](https://smithay.github.io/smithay-clipboard/).
