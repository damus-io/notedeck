# This is required to fix a problem compiling sdl2 v0.35.2 on macos with clang14
# until the rust-sdl project publishes a new version on crates.io with the fix that is in HEAD of Master
# See issues https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2/issues/1302 where reported to them, and comment
# https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2/issues/1302#issuecomment-1525745146 that indicates that a release may not
# be forthcoming very soon, hence this patch as a workaround.
