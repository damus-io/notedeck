# WebAssembly/wasm32 target support below
#
# There are two main WASM targets:
# - wasm32-unknown-unknown: Base WebAssembly standard, used in browsers
# - wasm32-wasi: Newer extension/standard, comes with basic std library,
#   not supported in browsers (yet)
#
# Some things work in all WASM configurations, some work only on one of these two,
# some things don't work on wasm32 at all.
#
# wasm32-unknown-unknown requires wasm_bindgen and wasm_bindgen_test to work,
# but these can cause problems on wasm32-wasi. So we use either
# - target_arch = "wasm32" for things that (don't) work on all WebAssembly targets or
# - explicit targetting for wasm32-unknown-unknown or wasm32-wasi.
#   In Cargo.toml, this is done via [target.<target-triple>.dependencies]
#   In code, this is done via cfg(all(target_arch = "wasm32", target_os = "wasi"/"unknown"))

# The rayon feature does not work on any wasm32 target
