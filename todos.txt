- [ ] in crates/notedeck_dave, when an agent steals focus from another agent to ask a question, i want it to focus back to where it was

- [x] in crates/notedeck_dave, i want to be able to switch to plan mode like you can in the claude-code cli. I believe there

- [x] plan: plan a feature for creating a queue of tool requests/questions 

- [x] plan: need a way to respond to a approve/deny in crates/notedeck_dave but giving a response as well

- [x] plan: plan a way to run claude commands such as /compact, with the ability to specify arguments as well (/compact <input>) etc

- [x] have the default view be classic instead of scene view. also don't call it classic, call it list

- [ ] make crates/notedeck_dave/src/lib.rs smaller

- [x] update [1] Yes and [2] No options to Allow/Deny, use key indicator widget instead of [1] text

- [x] have the approve/deny message appear near the bottom right of the diff instead of top right

- [x] ctrl-shift-tab should go in reverse node selection order

- [ ] chat sidebar text should show the user's or AI's last message, not our last message

- [ ] add a modeswitch (ctrl-something) for "auto-steal focus". when enabled, AI requests instantly steal focus. when disabled, requests are queued instead

- [ ] add keybinding to open external editor (like vim) for composing input

- [ ] auto-accept mode: add a toggle that automatically approves agent tool calls without requiring manual confirmation. useful for trusted tasks or batch mode. could be global or per-agent

- [ ] persist conversation across app restarts

- [ ] handle ExitPlanMode which simply exits plan mode. claude-code sends this when its done its planning phase

- [x] handle claude-code questions/answers (AskUserQuestion tool - could be a list of questions)

- [x] AskUserQuestion: show a small summary view of the question and selected option(s) after answering

- [ ] auto-accept single line changes: automatically approve Edit tool calls that only modify a single line, reducing confirmation friction for trivial edits

- [ ] preserve edit view after approval/denial: when approving or denying an edit, keep the diff visible instead of making it disappear. allows reviewing what was changed even after responding
