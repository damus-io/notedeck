- [x] in crates/notedeck_dave, when an agent steals focus from another agent to ask a question, i want it to focus back to where it was

- [ ] make crates/notedeck_dave/src/lib.rs smaller

- [ ] chat sidebar text should show the user's or AI's last message, not our last message

- [ ] add a modeswitch (ctrl-something) for "auto-steal focus". when enabled, AI requests instantly steal focus. when disabled, requests are queued instead

- [ ] add keybinding to open external editor (like vim) for composing input

- [ ] auto-accept mode: add a toggle that automatically approves agent tool calls without requiring manual confirmation. useful for trusted tasks or batch mode. could be global or per-agent

- [ ] persist conversation across app restarts

- [ ] handle ExitPlanMode which simply exits plan mode. claude-code sends this when its done its planning phase

- [ ] auto-accept single line changes: automatically approve Edit tool calls that only modify a single line, reducing confirmation friction for trivial edits

- [ ] preserve edit view after approval/denial: when approving or denying an edit, keep the diff visible instead of making it disappear. allows reviewing what was changed even after responding
